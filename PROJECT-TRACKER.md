# Diptychon — Project Tracker

Dual-panel macOS file manager. MVP PRD: `.scratch/diptychon-mvp/PRD.md`.

## Build & run
No Xcode installed — built with Command Line Tools via SwiftPM.
```
./scripts/run.sh          # swift build → wrap minimal .app → launch
DIPTYCHON_DIR=/path open --env DIPTYCHON_DIR=/path Diptychon.app   # open a specific folder
```
Toolchain note: the CLT must have a *matched* compiler+SDK. A mismatch (compiler
`…1.10` vs SDK `…1.5`) broke all builds on 2026-06-17; fixed by reinstalling CLT
(`softwareupdate -i "Command Line Tools for Xcode-16.2"`).

### Issue 04 outcome (2026-06-18)
Reversible-`Operation` spine (ADR 0004): `Operation` protocol + `CopyOperation`
(records created URLs for revert; overwrite = not undoable), `OperationCoordinator`
(undo/redo stacks, progress, cancel), data-driven `Keymap`. Commander gesture
⌥⌘→/← copies Active selection into Inactive Panel; collision dialog
(overwrite/keep-both/skip) pre-write; ⌘Z/⇧⌘Z multi-level. Keyboard owned by an
`NSEvent` local monitor (a focused `Table` swallows arrow keys otherwise); active
Panel set by which window-half was clicked; double-click-to-open also via the
monitor. User-verified end to end.

Bugs found + fixed this slice (good lessons):
- **QWERTZ keyboard**: matching ⌘Z by hardware keyCode 6 = `y` on German layout.
  Fix: match letters by character, arrows/Tab by keyCode.
- **Single-click selection eaten** by a `.onTapGesture(count: 2)` on the Name
  cell. Fix: no tap gesture; double-click via mouse monitor; `Table` keeps native
  single-click select.
- **Active-panel switching** can't derive from selection changes (re-clicking an
  already-selected row fires nothing). Fix: `leftMouseDown` monitor sets active by
  window half.
- `visibleItems` recomputed every render -> cache it (recompute on filter/sort/
  contents change only).

### Gotchas (no-Xcode / SwiftPM bundle)
- **SwiftUI needs `NSHostingController`, not the `App`/`WindowGroup` lifecycle.**
  Under a hand-wrapped `.app`, SwiftUI windows render but get NO input events.
  Fix: explicit AppKit entry (`main.swift` + `AppDelegate`) building an `NSWindow`
  with `window.contentViewController = NSHostingController(rootView:)`. Reverts to
  plain SwiftUI `App` once on real Xcode. See `App/DiptychonApp.swift`.
- Window may open on an external display / wrong Space -> force onto primary
  (`NSScreen` origin `.zero`) + `makeKeyAndOrderFront` + `NSApp.activate`.
- Localized folder names (`Musik` vs `Music`) only show once app is localized;
  `localizedNameKey` falls back to raw on-disk name otherwise.

### Issue 01 outcome (2026-06-17)
Tracer bullet works: app launches to one Panel listing a real directory
(name/size/date) via SwiftUI `Table`. Two ADR seams shipped:
- **ADR 0003** `PanelSource` protocol + `LocalDirectorySource` (loads off-main
  via `Task.detached`, prefetches resource keys).
- **ADR 0002** `FileListView` protocol + `TableFileListView`, swappable via the
  `PanelFileList` typealias.
Verified by screenshot on home dir and on a 50k-file folder (loaded off-thread,
virtualized render, no block/crash). Subjective scroll-smoothness left for human.

Open polish (non-blocking): empty files render "Zero KB"; folders show no size
by design.

### Issue 02 outcome (2026-06-17)
Single Panel now navigable: enter dir (Return / double-click), up (⌘↑ / button),
column-header sort (toggle reverses), Hidden checkbox, type-ahead Filter field.
`PanelModel` v2 owns `directory: URL` and rebuilds `LocalDirectorySource` per
load (cancels in-flight task on rapid nav). `FileListView` protocol widened to
carry selection + sortOrder bindings + `onActivate` (still impl-agnostic, ADR
0002). `FileItem` gained non-optional `sizeForSort`/`dateForSort` (Optional isn't
Comparable). Verified interactively by user.

### Issue 03 outcome (2026-06-17)
`WorkspaceView` renders two Panels side by side, each owning its own `PanelModel`
(-> independent dir, nav, selection). Active Panel tracked via `@FocusState`,
shown with an accent border; Tab flips active, clicking a panel activates it. Nav
keys gated by `isActive`. `PanelView` no longer owns its model (parent owns).
`URL.startDirectory` moved to WorkspaceView. Window widened to 1100x620.
Verified interactively by user (Tab + click focus, independent nav, per-panel
selection).
